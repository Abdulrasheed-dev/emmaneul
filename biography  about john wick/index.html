        John Wick is an American neo-noir action film series and media franchise created by Derek Kolstad. It centers around the titular character, a legendary hitman who is reluctantly drawn back into the criminal underworld after retiring. The franchise began with the release of John Wick in 2014, followed by three sequels: Chapter 2 in 2017, Chapter 3 – Parabellum in 2019, and Chapter 4 in 2023.[1][2]

        The franchise has various spin-offs in development, beginning with the limited series The Continental: From the World of John Wick debuting in 2023, and the film Ballerina scheduled for a 2025 release.[3] The films have received critical acclaim and earned a collective gross of more than $1 billion worldwide.[4]
        
        Chad Stahelski, Basil Iwanyk, and Erica Lee serve in oversight roles for the John Wick franchise. 87Eleven Productions produces the franchise in collaboration with Thunder Road Studios and Lionsgate.[5]
        John Wick takes his fight against the High Table global as he seeks out more powerful players in the underworld from different countries.

In May 2019, prior to the release of John Wick: Chapter 3 – Parabellum, Chad Stahelski confirmed on a Reddit "Ask Me Anything" thread that there has been discussion of another film.[9] Keanu Reeves has also stated that he would continue as long as the films are successful.[10] Lionsgate announced the film during John Wick 3's opening week, with a scheduled release date of May 21, 2021.[11] However, in April 2020, during an interview with Collider, Stahelski revealed that the film would most likely not make its 2021 release date due to his commitment to The Matrix Resurrections.[1] He also revealed, during the same interview, that a 100-page "scriptment" (part script/part outline) had been written for the film.[1] The screenplay was written by Shay Hatten and Michael Finch, as the studio decided to move on from series creator Derek Kolstad.[12][13] Production was due to commence in June 2021 in Paris and Berlin, with additional filming in Japan and New York City.[14] Partly due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the film was released on March 24, 2023.[2] In June 2021, Donnie Yen, Rina Sawayama, Shamier Anderson, Bill Skarsgård and Hiroyuki Sanada joined the cast.[15][16][17][18] Principal photography began on June 28, 2021.[19] In October 2021, principal photography had wrapped.[20]

Future films
Ballerina (2025)
Main article: Ballerina (2025 film)
In July 2017, Lionsgate announced the development of a spin-off film written by Shay Hatten and titled Ballerina. The studio intends to expand the franchise with installments set within the same fictional world. The story, written as a spec script based on Hatten's love for the John Wick films before being purchased by Lionsgate,[21] involves a young woman who is raised to be an assassin who seeks revenge on the hitmen who killed her family. Basil Iwanyk and Erica Lee will serve as producers. The project will be developed by Thunder Road Films production studio.[22]

In October 2019, Len Wiseman signed onto the project as director, with Keanu Reeves and Chad Stahelski serving as a executive producer and producer, respectively. The film will follow the same ballerina character previously portrayed by Unity Phelan in John Wick: Chapter 3 – Parabellum.[23][24] In May 2020, Stahelski stated that Wiseman had read the script earlier, and approached the studio with a pitch of how he would develop the project, based on Hatten's draft, for which the proof of concept had previously been uploaded to YouTube in September 2017.[25] Stahelski met with Wiseman, and approached executives to hire the filmmaker. He confirmed that he and his team will work closely with Wiseman on the action sequences and stunts for the film, while acknowledging that Wiseman's filmmaking style will add variety to the franchise. At that point, Wiseman and Hatten were working on a newer draft of the script.[26] In May 2020, it was reported that the studio is looking for an actress, with Chloë Grace Moretz as the template for the kind of talent they are looking for.[27] In October 2021, Ana de Armas entered early negotiations to portray the titular character.[28] By April 2022 at CinemaCon, Lionsgate announced that de Armas will star in the lead role, with principal photography to commence later that summer.[29] In July of the same year, it was revealed that de Armas had personally selected Emerald Fennell to contribute to the script as one of its writers.[30]

In September 2022, it was announced that principal photography had been delayed from its previous tentative start and will commence later that fall.[31] In November 2022, principal photography was scheduled to begin imminently.[32] Reprising roles were announced for Ian McShane and Keanu Reeves as Winston Scott and John Wick, respectively, followed by Anjelica Huston as The Director and Lance Reddick as Charon.[33] Filming began on November 7, 2022, in Prague, Czech Republic.[34]

Ballerina is scheduled to be released in the United States on June 6, 2025.[35] It was delayed from a June 7, 2024 release.[36]

John Wick: Chapter 5
In August 2020, Lionsgate CEO Jon Feltheimer confirmed that a fifth film was also being developed. It was intended to be shot back-to-back with the fourth installment in early 2021, but in March 2021, Lionsgate opted to delay production and move forward with Chapter 4 first.[37][14] In May 2022, Stahelski stated that while Chapter 4 has some "conclusion" elements to the story, there would be a fifth installment to the franchise.[38] Following the release of the fourth movie, the filmmaker stated that he and Reeves wanted to complete some other projects, acknowledging that he would like to gain additional experience as a director, before continuing forward with another movie. Stahelski stated that though Chapters 4 and 5 were originally intended to be filmed back-to-back, he didn't feel like he could create two meaningfully successful and separate installments, without some time between each project to grow as a filmmaker;[39] stating that once Chapter 4 is released months later in Japan, he and Reeves will discuss and map out the future of the John Wick movies.[40] He also confirmed that he and Reeves will remain involved in the additional projects of the franchise that are currently in development, though the premise for Chapter 5 is not mapped out yet.[41] Later that same month, following the financial and critical success of Chapter 4, producer Erica Lee stated she was hopeful for a fifth film among projects expanding the universe currently in development.[42] By November 2023 following the resolution of the writers and actors strikes, Lionsgate revealed that work on the script for the fifth film had officially resumed.[43]

Other potential projects
Lionsgate has a number of additional projects in various stages of development, set within the same fictional continuity as the John Wick films. In March 2023, producer Erica Lee stated that in addition to previous identified projects, there's "... lots of other things. But we're developing a lot of stuff and having a lot of discussions with a lot of writers and brand management and Wick... is my utmost priority."[42] Stahelski has expressed interest in seeing additional actors join the franchise, such as: Cillian Murphy, Jet Li, Jackie Chan, Bob Odenkirk, Jason Statham, Sylvester Stallone, Clint Eastwood, Jason Momoa, Matt Damon, Chris Hemsworth, Colin Farrell, Charlize Theron, Michelle Yeoh, Peter Dinklage, Jurnee Smollett, Robert Downey Jr., Sean Bean, Jeff Wincott, Jeff Speakman, Tyrese Gibson, Ludacris, Jamie Foxx and Brad Pitt.[44][45][39] Lee stated that with various projects in development, the studio may develop some prequel installments as well.[46] That same month, Natalia Tena expressed interest in reprising her role as Wick's adoptive cousin/surrogate sister Katia, in future installments of the franchise.[47] In November 2023, Stahelski confirmed that multiple projects were in development, while acknowledging that there are plans to explore the various criminal organization establishments within the continuity; including Italian, French, Japanese, Chinese, Middle-Eastern, Indonesian, and Russian cultures.[48] Later following the resolutions to the 2023 writers and actors strikes, Lionsgate officially announced that work on various spin-off projects had commenced.[43]

Atomic Blonde crossover: In July 2017, David Leitch was asked about the potential for a crossover involving the franchise's titular killer and Lorraine Broughton. Leitch directed the latter project after co-directing John Wick. The filmmaker stated that it sounded like a great idea.[49]
Nobody crossover: In March 2021, Kolstad was asked about the potential for a crossover between the John Wick franchise and Nobody. As the films are distributed by different companies (Lionsgate and Universal, respectively), Kolstad indicated this was unlikely and stated the franchises were "very different"; at most, he would like to see it done in a small and subtle Easter egg-reference manner.[50] Later that month, director Ilya Naishuller was asked about a potential crossover and, pointing out that two different studios are involved, said "That's all I'll say. I mean, everything's possible. Stranger things have definitely happened, but... yeah.”[51] In June 2021, Kolstad stated that if there were any crossover, he would prefer it in a minimalist fashion, and opined that he would prefer John Wick and Hutch Mansell be on the same side should the characters share more screen time.[52]
Sofia: In February 2022, Halle Berry stated that though a spin-off film centering around her role as Jinx from the James Bond installment Die Another Day never materialized, there is ongoing discussions for a film featuring her character Sofia from John Wick: Chapter 3 – Parabellum.[53] In March 2023, producer Erica Lee stated that future projects will explore the recurring theme of dogs within the franchise, including Halle Berry's role as Sofia.[46] Later that month, Shamier Anderson stated that the background story of his character from John Wick: Chapter 4 includes having a familial relationship to Berry's character. The actor confirmed discussions for the potential of his character to appear in additional installments of the franchise, while expressing interest in doing so.[54] In November of the same year, Stahelski confirmed that a project including the two characters is in development.[48]
The Bowery King: In March 2023, Lee expressed interest in exploring a film that more greatly explores the history of The Bowery King, portrayed in the franchise by Laurence Fishburne.[55] She later stated that she has personal interest in realizing a project that features the character and his backstory.[46] In November of the same year, Stahelski confirmed that there are projects in development which will include the Bowery King, and his homeless criminal organization.[48]
Akira and Caine: Erica Lee expressed interest in a project centered around the backstory of the character portrayed by Rina Sawayama, named Akira.[55] She later clarified that she personally is interested in seeing a spin-off featuring the character become a reality.[46] In March 2023, Donnie Yen expressed interest in reprising his role from Chapter 4 in a potential spin-off centered around his character Caine. The actors stated there are discussions for such a reprisal, serving as a continuation of Chapter 4's post-credits scene, depicting Akira seeking revenge by hunting Caine.[56] In November of the same year, Stahelski confirmed that there are projects in development that will further explore the story included in the post-credits of the fourth film.[48]
Ballerina sequel: In March 2023, producer Erica Lee stated that the studio has tentative plans to develop a sequel to Ballerina, starring Ana de Armas, with the actress set to reprise her role.[42]
Untitled film: In March 2023, producer Erica Lee stated that the studio is working on an as-of-yet untitled film that will further expand the franchise. Though she would not give any details at that time, she stated that it would be announced within the next couple of months.[42]
